# Uncommon Java Bug: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

This repository demonstrates a subtle yet common Java error: the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.  This exception is usually caused by off-by-one errors or incorrect calculations when accessing array elements. This specific example shows a classic case of accessing an index beyond the array's bounds, which is a common mistake in beginners, but even experienced developers might encounter it in complex scenarios. The solution shows how to mitigate the issue by checking index bounds before accessing the array.
